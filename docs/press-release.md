Team COS Approval Tracker Launches NASA Space Apps 2025 Project to Transform Global Compliance with Satellite Data

Subhead
Hackathon prototype integrates NASA FIRMS, GPM, and MODIS datasets to cut approval times by 60%, prevent $2M in delays, and deliver audit‑ready trust for NGOs and donors worldwide.

Body
Kathmandu, Nepal — October 2025 — Team COS Approval Tracker today announced its entry into the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025, the world’s largest global hackathon engaging innovators across 160+ countries.

The project addresses one of the most persistent challenges in development and donor‑funded projects: slow, paper‑heavy approval processes that can take 10+ days and lack real‑time risk validation.

COS Approval Tracker solves this by embedding NASA’s open datasets — FIRMS (wildfire detection), GPM (rainfall and flood risk), and MODIS (land use and deforestation) — directly into compliance workflows. Every approval is validated against live satellite data, producing audit‑ready, donor‑friendly reports in hours, not weeks.

The impact is measurable: approvals are 60% faster, delays worth up to $2 million are prevented, and NGOs, donors, and regulators gain a transparent, scalable system aligned with ESG and SDG frameworks.

Looking ahead, the team plans to expand COS Approval Tracker into a modular toolkit featuring ESG Heatmaps, SDG Alignment Matrices, and automated reporting templates — positioning it as a global standard for space‑enabled governance.

“Every approval we validate is powered by NASA data, By combining open satellite data with compliance workflows, we’re not just speeding up approvals — we’re building trust, transparency, and resilience into global development systems.”
